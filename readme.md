## 🎨 Customization Guide

### 🔧 Adjusting Sensitivity

| Setting       | Description               | Default Value |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| `SensSetting` | Recoil reduction strength | `1.0`         |

Modify in the script:

```lua
local SensSetting = 1.0  -- Adjust for different sensitivities
```

### 🖱️ Changing Key Bindings

Modify these values to set custom activation buttons:

```lua
local AKM = 4   -- Change to preferred button
local M416 = 5  -- Assign another weapon key
```

Find button IDs in **Logitech G Hub → Key Assignments**.

### 🎛️ Adjust Recoil Dynamically (For PUBG Script Users)

Increase or decrease recoil control while playing using **Logitech G Keys**:

```lua
if (event == "G_PRESSED" and arg == 8) then  -- G8 increases recoil control
    SensSetting = SensSetting + 0.05
    OutputLogMessage("Increased Recoil Compensation: " .. SensSetting .. "\n")
end

if (event == "G_PRESSED" and arg == 9) then  -- G9 decreases recoil control
    SensSetting = SensSetting - 0.05
    OutputLogMessage("Decreased Recoil Compensation: " .. SensSetting .. "\n")
end
```

🔹 Press **G8** to increase recoil control  
🔹 Press **G9** to decrease recoil control  
🔹 No need to restart the script! 🎯

💡 **Tip:** You can change `arg == 8` or `arg == 9` to any **G-key** on your Logitech keyboard/mouse. Just replace the number with your preferred keybinding.

---

## 🎛️ Dynamic Recoil Adjustment (Test Needed)

- Get the **[PUBG_Simple_NoRecoil_Adjustable.lua](https://share.google/MjHs08EoIzvvXw9un)** script.
- Open **Logitech G Hub** → Click on your **PUBG profile**.
- Go to **Scripting** (bottom left) → Click **Create New Lua Script**.
- **Paste the script** into the editor and **Save**

---

This script allows you to **increase or decrease recoil compensation in real-time** using **Mouse Side Buttons 4 & 5**:

```lua
if (event == "MOUSE_BUTTON_PRESSED" and arg == 4) then  -- Side Button 1 (Increase recoil control)
    SensSetting = SensSetting + 0.05
    OutputLogMessage("Increased Recoil Compensation: " .. SensSetting .. "\n")
end

if (event == "MOUSE_BUTTON_PRESSED" and arg == 5) then  -- Side Button 2 (Decrease recoil control)
    SensSetting = SensSetting - 0.05
    OutputLogMessage("Decreased Recoil Compensation: " .. SensSetting .. "\n")
end
```

🔹 Press **Mouse Button 4** to increase recoil control  
🔹 Press **Mouse Button 5** to decrease recoil control  
🔹 No need to restart the script! 🎯

💡 **Tip:** You can change `arg == 4` or `arg == 5` to any **mouse button you prefer**. Just replace the number with your chosen keybinding.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### ❌ Script Not Working?

🔹 Ensure **Logitech G Hub** is installed and running.  
🔹 Check if **Lua scripting is enabled** in G Hub.  
🔹 Assign the script to **PUBG’s profile**.  
🔹 Try **running G Hub as administrator**.

### 🎯 Recoil Feels Off?

🔹 Adjust the `SensSetting` value in the script:

```lua
local SensSetting = 1.0 -- Modify this based on your in-game sensitivity
```

🔹 Match **PUBG’s in-game sensitivity** settings.  
🔹 Test different **mouse DPI settings**.

### 🔄 Logitech G Hub Not Detecting the Script?

🔹 **Restart G Hub** and re-enable scripting.  
🔹 **Reinstall G Hub** if issues persist.  
🔹 **Delete & re-import** the script.
